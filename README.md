# RFPropagation

The Modelica library RFPropagation includes several of the best-known propagation models used to compute path losses between a radiowave source (radio transmitter) and a radiowave sink (radio receiver) under different scenarios. They address different attributes of the propagation channel: outdoor and indoor, LOS (Line-Of-Sight) and non-LOS, clear path and obstructed path, tropospheric and ionospheric. In addition, the library contains models of physical components such as generic antennas and cables that enables the calculation of link budgets.
